    "explain1":"1. What is Pressure Pig Association? ",
    "explain1_1":"Pressure Pig Association is a PFP project on Ethereum with a total of 9,999 and a launch date between March-April 2023. More than one hundred different traits. The mint price is 0.01ETH white list price is 0.008ETH. Creator earnings at 5%. ",
    "explain2":"2. What is the ideology of PPA?",
    "explain2_1":"This project is a product of pressure in this fucking world! Whether our origin or background, pressure is forced upon each one of us. Desires, loans, marriage, education, work, all sorts of fucking trouble!! PPA stands for Pressure pig association, which is a community that gathers people together to vent their pressure and relieve stress!",
    "explain3":"3. Why pigs?",
    "explain3_1":"Different from other NFT project fiction stories. Our NFT figures aren't from the post-apocalypse world nor from the future. They resemble you and me, the normal guys. After we are born, the wheel of fate kept pushing us forward. When we were young, we were sent to schools for education, after graduating we were then told to get jobs to make a living and get married. If you really think about it, how many of those things are out of our own will?  We are like pigs, born in the pigsty. Living the life someone else set for us. PPA figures are like mirrors, we hope you can find yourself in the PPA collection. ",
    "explain4":"4. What kind of benefits can you get for joining Piggy's shelter?",
    "explain4_1":"We will set several events and competitions in our discord channels, and each of the events will give out whitelists and OG roles.",
    "explain5":"5. What is the difference between the OG role and the whitelist?",
    "explain5_1":"OG roles share the whitelist privilege for buying NFT at a lower price, and are also guaranteed to share 10% or all revenue of NFT sales along with No.1-No.999 NFT holders.",
    "explain6":"6. How many times can I mint PPA with the same wallet address?",
    "explain6_1":"You can mint max to three PPA NFTs with the same wallet address.",
    "explain7":"7. Which Blockchain will PPA mint on?",
    "explain7_1":"Ethereum",
    "explain8":"8. What is the Mint Price?",
    "explain8_1":"0.006 for pressure list (WL)",
    "explain8_2":"0.01 for public",
    "explain9":"9. What is the Mint Date?",
    "explain9_1":"TBA",
    "explain10":"10. How many traits are there?",
    "explain10_1":"The team has been working on the PPA project for nearly 1 year. We developed nearly 130 individual hand-drawn traits.",
    "explain11":"11. How can I reach out to the PPA team?",
    "explain11_1":"You can email us at team@ppa-nft.xyz or Discord and Twitter.",
    "explain12":"12. Is PPA open to whitelist collaborations?",
    "explain12_1":"Yes we do. Please contact us on the collaboration channel on discord.",
    "explain13":"13. How do I stay updated and safe?",
    "explain13_1":"All updates for PPA will be made through the official PPA Twitter and Discord. There will never be a “surprise mint” or sudden instance where we will ask you to connect your wallet or send us any of your NFTs.",
    "explain13_2":"There are many steps you can take to protect yourself in the crypto and NFT space, at the bare minimum we highly recommend you use a Ledger or other cold wallet to store your assets.",
    "explain13_3":"Also, the majority of attacks we see on crypto users come in the form of social manipulation. Know that we will never contact you directly or act as a middle-man in a trade. If something sounds too good to be true, or requires urgent action so you don’t miss something, it is likely someone is trying to take advantage of you."
